# CalculatorV1.1
A simple calculator
The program is written in cpp language, while it can perform a simple calculation between 2 given numbers, which can be addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The program checks if the operation number was given correctly, if not it gives an error message while it can loop to make as much calculations as needed without having to restart the program until the correct exit answer is given. The only bug so far is 
that if the inputs that are needed for the operations are given as a letters, the program stucks in an endless error loop.
